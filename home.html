                <header><h1>Welcome to Daniel Ng, PLLC Account </h1></header>
               
                Our company is a complete services accounting and consulting company. 
                We offer our services to a large range of customers ranging from individuals to medium-sized companies.
                 We provides complete business services to our clients from setting up sole proprietor company,
                  C-Corporation, S-Corporation, and Partnership, LLC; helping apply restaurant, laundry, 
                  appearance enhancement and liquor licenses, etc.; establishing accounting system; selecting business software; preparing financial statements, audit report; filing Corp- tax, payroll tax, sales tax, individual income tax;  and handling business purchase and sold, exchanging, and dissolution.
<p>
 We realize that choosing a qualified CPA is a very important decision for any prospective client. Your accountant has frequent access to some of your most private and important information. A good working relationship with your accountant as a trusted advisor is mandatory. No website or list of credentials can be an adequate substitute for a face to face in-depth meeting to analyze and evaluate your business needs and develop a mutual comfort level.
<p>
We will answer all of your questions, as they impact both your tax and financial situations. We welcome you to contact us anytime. I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you at your business to discuss how my firm can assist you.

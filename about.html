 <p>
 We realize that choosing a qualified CPA is a very important decision for any prospective client. Your accountant has frequent access to some of your most private and important information. A good working relationship with your accountant as a trusted advisor is mandatory. No website or list of credentials can be an adequate substitute for a face to face in-depth meeting to analyze and evaluate your business needs and develop a mutual comfort level.
<p>
We will answer all of your questions, as they impact both your tax and financial situations. We welcome you to contact us anytime. I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you at your business to discuss how my firm can assist you.
